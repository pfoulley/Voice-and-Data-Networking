Internet service Provider simulation 
Communication is hardly achieved these days without the input of an Internet Service Provider (ISP). We now live in the “Internet of things age” and anyone using the internet or some form of connectivity will have their information passing through a layer 2 or 3 device in the internet backbone which might belong to an ISP.
Packet Tracer simulation
This project was compiled as a result of questions and ideas brought to me by some of my students. These questions and ideas resumed in a single statement; designing an ISP network that serve all kind of customers, all kind of services. While the internet may be full of sample material helping in this matter, I have tried as much as possible to mimic in this project the number of services offered by an ISP.
BIT is our service provider. Its main office is in Manchester and the simulation covers services in Manchester, London and Sheffield where it has operation branches. Due to packet tracer limitations, connectivity was achieved using minimal command. Anyone familiar with CCNA should be able to navigate each device easily and make sense of this work (and even improve it). However, I will advise those using this as a learning curve to read about:
•	VTP
•	VLAN
•	SPT
•	NAT
•	STATIC ROUTE
•	BGP
•	MULTI AREA OSPF
•	FRAME-RELAY
•	VoIP
•	HSRP
In future post, I will upload contents on this platform, dealing with the above technologies in details where ever possible. 
Please read the attached documentation file before attempting and change in the topology. The documentation contains all information about the devises used as well as configured port and their “neighbours”.
Note that this simulation was made for educational purpose only and cannot be reproduced in a real life without appropriate prior successful testing
I hope this will help.
Connect happily
